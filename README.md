## What is it?

Mindful Balance is a website with the dual purpose of providing mental health support to the general public and guidance to employers both based in the United Kingdom. 

The site contains information on the warning signs of a mental health crisis, a section on where to seek help and a section that outlines an employers responsibilities.

## UX

The website was designed to be clear, simplistic and calming. Information is provided clearly, concisely and in the order at which it is best actioned. 

The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the page in order to make nagivation as simple as possible and for redundancy, the Logo, website name and home button will all take the user back to the index page. 

All external links open to a new tab in order to avoid the user not returning after looking at external resources.
